# Libft
This project creates custom implementations of standard C library functions.


The "libft" is the base project of École 42, serving as a library of auxiliary functions that also covers a significant portion of the Common Core curriculum at 42. It includes functionalities such as string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list handling, and character manipulation.

This library can be utilized across various projects at 42, saving time and effort while allowing developers to focus on the core logic of their tasks.

In summary, the "libft" is a versatile resource at École 42, providing essential functions for common programming tasks and facilitating the development process across different projects.
